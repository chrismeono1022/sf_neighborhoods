# San Francisco and Oakland Neighborhoods Map

This simple rails application displays a map of San Francisco and Oakland neighborhoods based on [ZillowÂ Neighborhood Boundaries](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm) data.

The parsed data can be found in /public/sf-oak-neighborhoods.json. I took the Zillow Neighborhood Boundaries and converted them to GeoJSON via [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html).

If you want to do this yourself, unzip the data files and run:
```sh
$ ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -where 'CITY="San Francisco" OR CITY="Oakland"' < your_filename.json > < the_source_filename.shp >
```

I used the [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) for the base map and added the GeoJSON file as a [data layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/datalayer), which draws the neighborhood Polygons based on the coordinates from the file.

I then used the Mouseover event handler to expose the neighborhood name when you hover over it.

I'm currently working on a feature to enable the user to type in their address and let them know what neighborhood they live in. More to come soon.
